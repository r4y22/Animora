## Project Description  
Animora is a virtual pet game designed to simulate the experience of caring for a digital pet, allowing users to manage various aspects of pet well-being, including hunger, happiness, and health. Inspired by popular games like Tamagotchi and Nintendogs, Animora offers an immersive and educational experience where players will learn to balance daily tasks and maintain their pet's happiness and health. Each pet in Animora is unique, with its own attributes and behaviors, adding complexity to the gameplay. Players will select their pet (Phoenix, Dragon, and Pegasus) which are inspired by Greek mythology, giving the game a twist from the usual animal choices. We chose a pixel theme, reflected in the visuals and backgrounds, to create a nostalgic and engaging experience. Players can name their pet and monitor its needs, providing a rich experience while adhering to the project's educational goals.

The game includes the following features:

Game Start Screen: Welcome interface to start a new game or continue an existing one.
Choose Pet Screen: Enables players to choose their virtual pet from a selection of options.
Game Play Screen: The main interface for interacting with your pet, including feeding, playing, and other care activities.
Vital Statistics Screen: Displays the pet's health, happiness, and other stats to track progress.
Settings Screen: Allows players to adjust game settings, such as volume or graphics.
Game Play Controls Screen: Offers instructions on how to navigate and interact with the game.
Inventory Screen: A section to manage items used to take care of the pet.
Parental Controls Screen: Provides tools for parents to manage game settings for younger players.
Tutorial Screens (6): Step-by-step instructions for new players to learn how to take care of their pet.
Game Over Screen: Appears if the player's pet becomes too unhappy or unhealthy due to neglect.

The primary objective of Animora is to teach users responsibility in a fun and interactive way. The game is suitable for all ages, with additional parental controls to ensure a safe and tailored experience for younger users.

## Parental Controls

Parental Controls screen allows parents to limit the amount of time their child can play the game if their child is playing too much. To access the parental controls screen, parents have to go to settings and then click parental controls and enter the PIN 1234. Parents can use the parental controls screen to set the maximum amount of time their child can play per session and limit their screen time on certain days of the week. In this context, session  means the time between when the application is opened and when the application is closed.  If the child has reached the maximum amount of time they are allowed to play the game, the game will be disabled. Parents can disable or enable the feature that allows them to limit their child's screentime whenever they want. Any limit that is set by the parents will be saved once set and will not change when the user quits the game. This game also keeps track of the total time the child has played, the average playtime per session and allows the parents to see those statistics. The statistics about the child's playtime will be saved and will not be deleted after the child exits and re-opens the game. Anytime when the application is running counts towards playtime regardless of whether it's the parent looking at the statistics of the app usage or it's the child playing the game. Parents can reset the total playtime and the average playtime to zero whenever they want. This feature allows the parents to keep track of their child's playtime over a certain time period. Parents can also select a saved gameplay and revive a pet.
